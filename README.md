# Project-Library

This work is for The Odin Project.

https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library

I finised for the most part of this project.(demo here: https://zan-hiro.github.io/Project-Library/)

But, localStorage part is not finished.(Optional part)

So, if you add the new book in the list and reload browser, your adding list will disappear.(not remaing data on the browser).

I wolud like to add localStorage function in the near future.(Probably)

Thank you read this message.

Have a nice day, and happy coding.
