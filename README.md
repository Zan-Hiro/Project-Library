# Project-Library

This work is for The Odin Project.

I finised for the most part of this project.

But, localStorage part is not finished.

So, if you add the new book in the list and reload browser, your adding list will disappear.(not remaing data on the browser).

I wolud like to add localStorage function in the near future.

Thank you read this message.

Have a nice day, and happy coding.
